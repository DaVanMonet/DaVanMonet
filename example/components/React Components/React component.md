# React component example 
This file shows how you can get a preview of a React component.

Instead of showing html you choose react as the preview language.

If you want to preview a specific component you need to declare it in ReactComponents.jsx and add the imported component to the constant "AllComponents". In your render preview you need to only declare the component tag such as in this example


## Base state
This is the button when it has no other state
```react
<ReactExampleComponent></ReactExampleComponent>
```
